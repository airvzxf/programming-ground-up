This book is not a reference book, it is an introductory book. It is
therefore not suitable by itself to learn how to professionally program
in x86 assembly language, as some details have been left out to make the
learning process smoother. The point of the book is to help the student
understand how assembly language and computer programming works, not to
be a reference to the subject. Reference information about a particular
processor can be obtained by contacting the company which makes it.
