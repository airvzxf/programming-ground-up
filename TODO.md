### Me.

- [x] Generate my theme of GNU Assembler and apply to the fenced code blocks. [Pandoc: Syntax highlighting](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#syntax-highlighting).
- [ ] Fix the missing include files with the source code.
- [ ] Reduce the text columns for every assembly source file which is broken in the ePUB version, the limit is 71 characters.
- [ ] Fix the cover and pages for PDF and ePUB also fixed the error in the HTML5 version.
- [ ] Add my own page in the book talking about the project and refer the GitHub Repository link.
- [ ] Create a ToC (Table of contents).
- [ ] Review, execute and correct all the assembly source files.
- [ ] Add to all the examples code a note about use GDB to see what is happening.
- [ ] Rename the assembly source files with the prefix chapters and appendixes `001-`, `012`, `AA-` and `AF-`.
- [ ] Create a script to compile all the exercises. Removed the folder repository "airvzxf/assembly/linux/gas/programmingGroundUp" and add in the README file the reference to this project.
- [ ] Complete all my peronsal To-Do's which are hardcoded in the book.
- [ ] Create releases as `./releases/v2020.12.01/ProgrammingGroundUp.epub`. Create commands in the `./make` script to replace the version (`text: x86 v2020.12`) inside of the `001-ProgrammingGroundUp.txt` file.
- [x] Update the GDB debug appendix.
  - [x] Example: `as --gstabs` vs `as --gstabs+`

### Author notes.
- [ ] General.
  - [ ] Dominique suggests I have an appendix of registers. Maybe in the Instructions appendix?
  - [ ] Need to find places that need more filling out.  Reviews, definitely.
  - [ ] Go back through and make sure that registers and memory are both fully described and fully distinguished.
  - [ ] Instructions needs some more beef from reference books.
  - [ ] Appendices.
    - [ ] A full description of the calling sequence for UNIX.
    - [ ] A complete examination of the fetch-execute cycle.
    - [ ] A complete listing of registers and flags.
- [ ] Chapter 2 â†’ Data Accessing Methods.
  - [ ] This would be a good section for diagrams.
