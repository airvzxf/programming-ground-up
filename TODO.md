# TO-DO's

## Me.
- [ ] Generate my theme of GNU Assembler and apply to the fenced code blocks. [Pandoc: Syntax highlighting](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#syntax-highlighting).
- [ ] Create releases as `./releases/v2020.11.01/ProgrammingGroundUp.epub`. Create commands in the `./make` script to replace the version (`text: x86 v2020.11`) inside of the `001-ProgrammingGroundUp.txt` file.
- [ ] Update the GDB debug appendix.
  - [ ] Example: `as --gstabs` vs `as --gstabs+`
- [ ] Refer the GDB debug in the review sections for chapter 3.
- [ ] Add appendix for the solutions for every chapter.
  - [ ] Chapter 2.
  - [ ] Chapter 3.
- [ ] Add to all the examples code a note about use GDB to see what is happening.

## Pending in the official website.
- [ ] Apply the bugs reported in the official resource page: [https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=pgubook](https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=pgubook).
- [ ] Apply the support requests in the official resource page: [https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?group=pgubook](https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?group=pgubook).

## Author notes.
- [ ] General.
  - [ ] Dominique suggests I have an appendix of registers. Maybe in the Instructions appendix?
  - [ ] Need to find places that need more filling out.  Reviews, definitely.
  - [ ] Go back through and make sure that registers and memory are both fully described and fully distinguished.
  - [ ] Instructions needs some more beef from reference books.
  - [ ] Appendices.
    - [ ] A full description of the calling sequence for UNIX.
    - [ ] A complete examination of the fetch-execute cycle.
    - [ ] A complete listing of registers and flags.
- [ ] Chapter 2 â†’ Data Accessing Methods.
  - [ ] This would be a good section for diagrams.
