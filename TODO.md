## Author notes.
- [ ] General.
  - [ ] Dominique suggests I have an appendix of registers. Maybe in the Instructions appendix?
  - [ ] Need to find places that need more filling out.  Reviews, definitely.
  - [ ] Go back through and make sure that registers and memory are both fully described and fully distinguished.
  - [ ] Instructions needs some more beef from reference books.
  - [ ] Appendices.
    - [ ] A full description of the calling sequence for UNIX.
    - [ ] A complete examination of the fetch-execute cycle.
    - [ ] A complete listing of registers and flags.
- [ ] Chapter 2 â†’ Data Accessing Methods.
  - [ ] This would be a good section for diagrams.
